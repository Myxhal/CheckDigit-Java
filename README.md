# CheckDigit-Java
A Java program that calculates the check digit for a 12- or 13-digit number using modular arithmetic. The check digit is computed based on summing every other digit from right to left, applying specified rules, and outputting the final result. This method is commonly used in validation processes such as ISBN codes.
